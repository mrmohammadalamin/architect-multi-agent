            "description": "This strategy prioritizes certainty and predictability. It involves a comprehensive, multi-stage pre-construction phase to complete all critical investigations (Geotechnical, Flood Risk Assessment, Utility Capacity) before finalizing the design. Construction only begins once ground conditions, flood mitigation requirements, and utility connection costs are fully understood and priced. This approach minimizes the risk of in-project cost overruns and delays at the expense of a longer overall project timeline."

            "description": "This option prioritizes completing the project in the shortest possible time. It would utilize off-site construction methods, such as prefabricated Structural Insulated Panels (SIPs) or a modular frame, to reduce on-site construction duration and mitigate risks from traffic congestion. This approach overlaps design and construction phases (Design-Build) and accepts a higher financial risk, requiring a larger contingency fund to address potential issues like ground conditions or utility upgrades that are discovered mid-project."

            "description": "This strategy positions the project as a showcase of cutting-edge sustainable design, aiming for a prestigious certification like Passivhaus or BREEAM 'Outstanding'. It assumes a budget at the top of the range ($1.5M+) to incorporate best-in-class technologies that may exceed the initial brief (e.g., triple-glazing, advanced heat recovery). Schedule and cost are secondary to achieving the highest possible performance and creating a flagship property for 'The Future Homes Co.'."

            "description": "This strategy aims to deliver all the client's desired features while targeting the lower end of the budget range (~$800k). It involves a rigorous value engineering process where every component\u2014from the type of green roof to the brand of smart HVAC\u2014is selected based on the best balance of cost, performance, and reliability. It prioritizes proven, cost-effective technologies over bespoke or experimental systems to ensure the project meets its core sustainability and smart home goals without exceeding a strict budget."
