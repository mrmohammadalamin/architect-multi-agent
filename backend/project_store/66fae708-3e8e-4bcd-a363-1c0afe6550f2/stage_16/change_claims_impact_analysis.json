    "impact_analysis": {
        "cost_impact": "A significant cost increase is anticipated, estimated between $450,000 and $600,000. This is driven by several factors: 1) Immediate costs for additional geotechnical investigation and engineering fees for foundation redesign. 2) Direct construction costs for over-excavation of unsuitable soil, disposal fees, procurement and placement of engineered fill, and construction of a more robust and expensive foundation system (e.g., drilled piers instead of standard footings). 3) Indirect costs arising from project delays, including extended general conditions, site supervision, and equipment rental. 4) Contractor's overhead and profit on the additional scope of work, as stipulated in the contract.",
        "schedule_impact": "A critical delay to the project's completion date is expected, estimated at 6 to 8 weeks. The impact stems from: 1) Initial work stoppage in the foundation area pending investigation (1-2 weeks). 2) Time required for geotechnical analysis, foundation redesign, and review/approval by the owner and authorities (2-3 weeks). 3) Additional construction duration for soil remediation and building the more complex foundation system (3-4 weeks). As foundation construction is on the critical path, this delay will directly translate to a later project completion date unless acceleration measures are approved and funded.",
        "quality_impact": "If managed correctly, the long-term quality and structural integrity of the residence will be enhanced. The revised foundation will be appropriately designed for the actual site conditions, preventing future issues like differential settlement, foundation cracking, and related structural damage. However, there is a short-term risk to quality if the remediation work is rushed or improperly supervised. Close monitoring of soil compaction, concrete testing, and pier installation is crucial to ensure the revised design's quality objectives are met."

    "management_process": [
        "Step 1: Formal Notification - The Contractor must immediately issue a formal written notice to the Owner/Architect detailing the unforeseen condition, as required by the contract, to preserve claim rights.",
        "Step 2: Investigation & Validation - The Owner's consultants (Geotechnical and Structural Engineers) will visit the site to verify the condition, potentially commissioning new soil tests to define the extent of the problem.",
        "Step 3: Solution & Directive - The design team will develop and propose a technical solution. The Owner may issue a Construction Change Directive (CCD) to authorize the contractor to proceed with time-sensitive work (e.g., over-excavation) on a time-and-materials basis while a final price is determined.",
        "Step 4: Change Order Request (COR) Submission - The Contractor will prepare and submit a detailed COR, including a full breakdown of all associated costs (labor, material, equipment, subcontractors, overhead) and a time impact analysis (TIA) justifying the requested extension to the contract duration.",
        "Step 5: Negotiation & Execution - The Owner's representative and the Contractor will review and negotiate the COR. Upon agreement, a formal Change Order is executed, officially modifying the contract sum and the project completion date.",
        "Step 6: Meticulous Documentation - All activities, costs, and delays associated with the change must be tracked separately. This includes daily reports, photos, material tickets, labor hours, and all correspondence to create a clear audit trail.",
        "Step 7: Schedule Update - Upon execution of the Change Order, the project schedule must be formally updated to incorporate the additional activities and reflect the new contract completion date."
