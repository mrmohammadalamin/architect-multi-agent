This is essential for airtight construction and mitigating external noise/pollutants.",

Chilled water can then be circulated to the HIUs (using models with an integrated cooling function). This provides a fully integrated, energy-efficient cooling solution to combat summer overheating, a significant risk identified by CIBSE TM59 analysis for London apartments."
