            "detail": "As the HVAC system is not yet specified, there is a major opportunity to integrate a highly efficient, low-carbon solution. Given the multi-unit nature and 'fabric-first' approach, recommend a centralized communal system. Options include: 1) A communal Air Source Heat Pump (ASHP) system providing heating and hot water to all units. 2) A Ground Source Heat Pump (GSHP) system, potentially using energy piles, which offers higher efficiency but requires geotechnical investigation. Both options would significantly reduce operational carbon emissions compared to traditional gas boilers."

            "opportunity": "Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR)",
            "detail": "A highly insulated and airtight building envelope, as proposed, requires controlled ventilation to ensure high indoor air quality and prevent moisture buildup. An MVHR system is essential. It extracts stale, moist air and uses its heat to pre-warm incoming fresh, filtered air, recovering up to 90% of the heat that would otherwise be lost. This drastically reduces the space heating demand."

            "detail": "While a 'fabric-first' approach is stated, specific targets should be set. Specify high-performance, triple-glazed windows with low-emissivity coatings and thermally broken frames to minimize heat loss. Focus on achieving a very high level of airtightness (e.g., below 1.5 m\u00b3/h/m\u00b2 @50Pa) through careful design of prefabricated junctions and on-site testing."

            "detail": "The integrated solar PV panels should be maximized for the available roof space, considering optimal orientation (south-facing) and tilt. Conduct a detailed solar feasibility study. Integrate a battery energy storage system (BESS) to store surplus solar-generated electricity for use during peak demand hours or at night, increasing self-consumption and grid resilience."

            "detail": "Implement a smart building management system (BMS) for the central plant. Within each unit, provide smart thermostats and energy monitoring displays to empower residents to manage their consumption. Sub-metering for heating, hot water, and electricity for each apartment is critical for fair billing and encouraging conservation."

This mitigates flood risk and reduces the burden on municipal sewer systems. The design should ensure proper drainage and integration with the rainwater harvesting collection system."
