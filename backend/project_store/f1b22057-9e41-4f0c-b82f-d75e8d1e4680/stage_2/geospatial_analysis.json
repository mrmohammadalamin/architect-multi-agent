    "topography_land_use": "The site is situated on generally flat terrain, characteristic of the Thames Valley and the wider London Basin. The dominant land use is dense urban and high-density residential, comprising a mix of terraced housing, apartment blocks, and commercial properties typical of a major Greater London metropolitan centre. Proximity to the Ilford town centre suggests a mixed-use environment with significant pedestrian and vehicle traffic.",
    "environmental_risks": "The primary environmental risk is flooding, both from surface water (pluvial) in a heavily urbanised area with high surface runoff, and from river sources (fluvial) due to the relative proximity of the River Roding floodplain. Geotechnical risks are significant, with the likely presence of London Clay Formation, a soil known for its high plasticity and shrink-swell potential, which can lead to ground subsidence or heave. There is a moderate-to-high probability of encountering contaminated land and made ground from previous cycles of demolition and development, a common issue in long-established urban areas. Seismic and wildfire risks are negligible for this region.",
    "infrastructure_accessibility": "Accessibility is excellent. The site is located in close proximity to major public transport infrastructure, including Ilford railway station, which is served by the Elizabeth Line and National Rail, providing rapid and direct access to Central London, Heathrow, and Essex. The area is also served by a comprehensive network of local bus routes. Vehicular access is supported by a dense local road network connecting to major arterial routes such as the A406 (North Circular Road) and the A12. All major utilities (water, drainage, gas, electricity, and high-speed telecommunications) are expected to be readily available within the public highway, though capacity analysis and potential service diversions will be critical project tasks."
