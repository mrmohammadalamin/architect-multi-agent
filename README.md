Multi Agent AI Solution for Construction architect 
# Construction AI Multi-Agent System

This project is a multi-agent system for managing construction projects, featuring a Flutter-based mobile frontend and a Python backend powered by FastAPI and Google's AI services.

## About the Project

The Construction AI Multi-Agent System is a workflow-driven platform that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents to manage construction projects from inception to completion. The system is designed to streamline project management, improve decision-making, and provide real-time insights into project status, risks, and financials.

## Features

- **Workflow-Driven Project Management:** Projects are managed through a series of predefined stages, ensuring a structured and consistent process.
- **Multi-Agent System:** A team of specialized AI agents work together to perform tasks such as client intake, design, risk assessment, and financial planning.
- **Real-time Dashboards:** The system provides real-time dashboards for monitoring project status, risks, and financials.
- **Artifact Management:** All project artifacts, such as design documents, reports, and images, are stored and managed within the system.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** The system includes decision gates where human approval is required to proceed, ensuring that project stakeholders are always in control.
- **Mobile-First Frontend:** A Flutter-based mobile application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.

## Meet the Agents

The Construction AI Multi-Agent System is powered by a team of specialized AI agents, each with a specific role in the construction project lifecycle. Here are the key agents in the system:

### Construction Agents

- **Project Manager Agent:** Orchestrates the entire project workflow, ensuring that tasks are completed on time and within budget.
- **Safety Inspector Agent:** Monitors the construction site for safety hazards and ensures compliance with safety regulations.
- **Logistics Coordinator Agent:** Manages the supply chain, ensuring that materials and equipment are delivered to the construction site as needed.

### Architectural Agents

- **Lead Architect Agent:** Responsible for the overall design of the building, ensuring that it meets the client's requirements and complies with building codes.
- **Structural Engineer Agent:** Analyzes the structural integrity of the building and designs the structural system.
- **MEP Engineer Agent:** Designs the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems for the building.

### Interior Design Agents

- **Interior Designer Agent:** Creates the interior design concept for the building, including the layout, materials, and finishes.
- **Lighting Designer Agent:** Designs the lighting system for the building, creating a comfortable and visually appealing environment.
- **Acoustic Consultant Agent:** Analyzes the acoustics of the building and designs solutions to control noise and improve sound quality.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
